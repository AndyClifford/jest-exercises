const { categorizeAge } = require('../categorizeAge');

// CHALLENGE: We want to write a function called categorizeAge that takes an age as input
// and returns a string that categorizes the age. The rules are as follows:
//
// If the age is less than 18 the age category is 'Minor'.
// If the age is between 18 and 65 the age category is 'Adult'.
// If the age is 65 or older the age category is 'Senior'.
//
// Write some test cases to support these rules.
// Then implement the function in categorizeAge.js to make your tests pass.
